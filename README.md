# tempconvert-javascript-code
Welcome to the Temperature Converter repository! This project explores various methods of creating temperature conversion tools using JavaScript. It serves as a practical learning resource for different programming techniques, styles, and approaches.
Project Overview
This repository contains multiple implementations of temperature converters, showcasing different JavaScript methodologies and design patterns. Each method highlights a unique approach to solving the problem of converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

Features
Basic Calculator: Simple functions for converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
HTML Forms: An interactive form-based converter using vanilla JavaScript and HTML.
JavaScript Classes: A class-based implementation encapsulating conversion logic.
ES6 Modules: Modular code using ES6 import/export syntax.
Functional Programming: Higher-order functions to handle conversions.
React Example: An interactive temperature converter built with React.
Getting Started
